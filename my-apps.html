          <p>To win this game, you only have to prevent the ball from falling below the screen. Your AI opponent will try to return the ball to you, so deflect the ball in their direction. You lose a life with each missed shot. The stages get harder as the game progresses.</p>

          <h3>HAKUNA MATATA</h3>
          <p>To collect as many bugs as you can is the game's main goal. If you miss one, a life is lost. Timon wills bugs at you, and you must eat them. You are Pumba the warthog. This was inspired by the Lion King video games and film franchise.</p>
