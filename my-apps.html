          <h3>1 TOUCH</h3>
          <p>You only need to stop the ball from going below the screen to win this game. Deflect the ball toward your AI opponent, who will attempt to return the ball to you. Every time you miss the ball, you lose a life. As the game progresses, the stages become harder.</p>

          <h3>HAKUNA MATATA</h3>
          <p>The primary objective of the game is to gather as many bugs as you can. A life is lost if you miss one. You must eat the bugs that Timon tosses at you. Pumba the warthog is you. The Lion King movie series and games served as an inspiration for this.</p>
